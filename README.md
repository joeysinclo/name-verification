# name-verification
This program asks you to enter your first name, last name, and middle name if possible, before displaying the entire name in a message window.

Additional rules are also set in place for this program:
1.) The program is set to where the first and last name are required, and sends an error message if either of these fields are left blank.
2.) The program will ask you if you have a middle name, at which point you will either select a "yes" or "no" button.  
3.) If "No" is selected, the program will simply skip the middle name. However, if "yes" is selected for middle name, you can enter your name like the other fields. 
4.) If you enter "yes" for middle name, then leave the field blank, the program will pull up a window stating "Middle name is left blank.  Is this correct?"  At this point, you will have to select a "Yes" or "No" button again.  If "Yes" is selected, it will ask you to enter your middle name again.  Otherwise, if you select "No", it will skip the middle name.
5.) Once your first, middle, and last name are entered, the system will display the entire name, then ask you a "Yes" or "No" question to verify if the information is correct.  
  If "Yes" is selected, it will display a window saying "Thank you <first name> <middle name> <last name>! Your name has been added to the database." If "No" is selected, the system will ask you to re-enter your name again, and you will be required to start over.
6.) The program automatically corrects grammar upon typing your name.  For example, if I type the name "john" or "jOhN", the system will correct it to "John".  This rule is applied to the first, middle, and last name.
